You will need to download and install the following libraries;

* JSON-RPC PHP (0.17)
	http://jsonrpcphp.org/download.php?file=tgz&package=light
	Extract the tar into the lib/ directory, this should give you the
	following required file lib/jsonrpcphp/includes/jsonRPCServer.php
* jQuery (1.7.1)
	http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Download_jQuery
	Download the the minimized library to htdocs/js/ and rename or 
	symlink the resulting file to jquery.min.js	
* jquery-json plugin (2.3)
	http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/downloads/list
	Download the the minimized library to htdocs/js/ and rename or 
	symlink the resulting file to jquery.json.min.js
* kadm5 (0.2.3)
	http://pecl.php.net/package/kadm5
	Download the library from PECL, compile, install and enable in php.ini
	file for your webserver. This will probably need patching, please see
	comments below.

It is highly reccomended that you set the webroot to htdocs/ instead of
the root kwebpass/ directory.

Edit the conf/config.php file to set the realms you wish to allow.


The current version of kadm5 is incompatible with current API of MIT kerberos,
so a patch in the following path is included to update the PECL kadm5 library; 
patches/kadm5-0.2.4-1.ekm.2012022.patch


You may also need to patch the JSON-RPC PHP library to handle Content-type
headers specfically set to UTF-8. This can be done by running the following
command in the root of kpassweb once JSON-RPC PHP
library has been installed;

# patch -p0 < patches/jsonRPCServer.php_UTF-8.patch
