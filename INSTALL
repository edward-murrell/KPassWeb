You will need to download and install the following libraries;

* PHP KADM5 PECL
	
* JSON-RPC PHP (0.17)
	http://jsonrpcphp.org/download.php?file=tgz&package=light
	Extract the tar into the lib/ directory, this should give you the
	following required file lib/jsonrpcphp/includes/jsonRPCServer.php
* jQuery (1.7.1)
	http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Download_jQuery
	Download the the minimized library to htdocs/js/ and rename or 
	symlink the resulting file to jquery.min.js	
* jquery-json plugin (2.3)
	http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/downloads/list
	Download the the minimized library to htdocs/js/ and rename or 
	symlink the resulting file to jquery.json.min.js

It is highly reccomended that you set the webroot to htdocs/ instead of
the root kwebpass/ directory.

Edit the conf/config.php file to set the domains you wish to allow.
